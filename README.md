The tool is available as an npm package over [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitg0).

Before installing the package, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)<code><img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/nodejs/nodejs.png"></code>.
Then you can install it by simple running the following command:

## ðŸŽ® Commands

Currently, we have the following 7 commands which will make you **Good To Go**, `gtg`:

### `gtg config`

Use this to set up your project's gitgo configuration. You will be asked certain questions regarding your commit and emoji preferences.

### `gtg version`

Use this to check the version of your installed gitg0 package.

### `gtg whoami`

Use this to get the list of commands along with their functions.

### `gtg start`

Use this before you you start working on a new issue so that we can suggest the branch names and commit messages automatically.

### `gtg display`

Use this to view the suggested branch name and commit title. You can also edit the suggested text based on your preference. This command should be run after `gtg start`.

### `gtg checkout`

This is a replacement for `git checkout -b` and will simply checkout with gitgo's suggested branch name.

### `gtg commit`

This is a replacement for `git commit -m` and will commit your files once added with gitgo's suggested commit message.
